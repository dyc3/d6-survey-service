Survey Service is a full stack web application that allows users to create surveys and collect responses. It was created as a project for SSW-322: Design 6 at Stevens Institute of Technology.

It's built using the following technologies:
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the frontend
- [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) for the backend
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database

See [architecture](docs/architecture.md) for more information about how it's designed.
